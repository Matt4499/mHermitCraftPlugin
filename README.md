# mHermitCraftPlugin
***Tested and working on Paper Spigot 1.16.1 (https://papermc.io)***

This is a Minecraft 1.16.1 plugin for Spigot/Paper/Bukkit with heavily commented code incase you're a learner.

It currently has a couple features:

## One Player Sleep

Only a single player needs to sleep in order to change the time to day.

- Checks if the player is still sleeping before changing the time
- Only changes the time once, incase multiple people have slept at the same time.

## Mob Head Drops

Drops mob heads when they're killed by players.

- Not all mobs added yet

## Elytra on ender dragon death

Apparently they do this in HermitCraft.

- Future versions will allow this to be toggled

## Shulker Drop Changes

- Makes shulkers drop 2 shells on death

## Anti Endermen Grief

- Prevents endermen from taking random blocks

## Disables fire tick/fire spread

- Disables fire from spreading

## World Border in overworld

Sets the world border on server start

- Centered @ 0, 0
- 12k size, 6k out in each direction
